\subsection{Database}

The data is stored in a flat file divided into blocks.
The file starts with some meta data related to free blocks and how many blocks are in use.
Each block can contain multiple documents.
Each document contains the size along with the data.
If during an insert the size of the data is too large to fit into the block then it is chunked into multiple blocks.

\begin{verbatim}

    const int BlockSize = 128;
    const int DocumentSize = 128;

    struct DataBase {
        int num_blocks;
        int file_size;
        Document *free_list;
        Block *Blocks;  // NumElements = file_size / (BlockSize + sizeof(int));
    };

    struct Block {
        int number_documents;
        Document docs[BlockSize];
    };

    struct Document {
        int length;
        void *next;
        char data[DOCUMENT_SIZE]
    };
